# Chai VC Platform

End-to-end healthcare credentialing and hiring verification.

## Deployment

The `k8s/backend-rollout.yaml` file demonstrates how to deploy the backend using
[Argo Rollouts](https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io). It defines a canary
strategy with automated analysis. The analysis succeeds only when the backend's
Prometheus metrics report a success rate of **95%** or higher and **no** HTTP
errors.

## Substrate Network Deployment

See [docs/substrate_eks_poa_setup.md](docs/substrate_eks_poa_setup.md) for instructions on deploying a permissioned Substrate network with Proof-of-Authority consensus on AWS EKS.
